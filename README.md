Attempt at a .NET Api Gateway

This project is aimed at people using .NET running 
a micro services / service orientated architecture 
that need a unified point of entry into their system.

In particular I want easy integration with 
IdentityServer reference and bearer tokens. 

We have been unable to find this in my current workplace
without having to write our own Javascript middlewares 
to handle the IdentityServer reference tokens. We would
rather use the IdentityServer code that already exists
to do this.

# How to use

Ocelot is designed to work with ASP.NET core only and is currently built to .NET Standard 1.4 [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library) documentation may prove helpful when working out if Ocelot would be suitable for you.

Install Ocelot and it's dependecies using nuget.

`Install-Package Ocelot -Version 0.0.1`
